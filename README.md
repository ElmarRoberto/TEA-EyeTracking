# TEA-EyeTracking

The following project aims to recognize user eyes movements through the camera realsense T265. Two activities are proposed to carry out this analysis:
1) The faces of Avengers's characters are going to be shown merged to each other by a photoshop process. The user's goal is to identify which half is whom.
2) A virtual ball will be moving around on the computer's screen. The user's goal is to visually follow that movement.
